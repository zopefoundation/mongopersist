0.6.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Switched to optimisitc data dumping, which approaches transactions by
  dumping early and as the data comes. All changes are undone when the
  transaction fails/aborts. See ``optimistic-data-dumping.txt`` for
  details. Here are some of the new features:

  * Data manager keeps track of all original docs before their objects are
    modified, so any change can be done.

  * Added an API to data manager (``DataManager.insert(obj)``) to insert an
    object in the database.

  * Added an API to data manager (``DataManager.remove(obj)``) to remove an
    object from the database.

  * Data can be flushed to Mongo (``DataManager.flush()``) at any point of the
    transaction retaining the ability to completely undo all changes. Flushing
    features the following characteristics:

    + During a given transaction, we guarantee that the user will always receive
      the same Python object. This requires that flush does not reset the object
      cache.

    + The ``_p_serial`` is increased by one. (Automatically done in object
      writer.)

    + The object is removed from the registered objects and the ``_p_changed``
      flag is set to ``False``.

    + Before flushing, potential conflicts are detected.

  * Implemented a flushing policy: Changes are always flushed before any query
    is made. A simple wrapper for the ``pymongo`` collection
    (``CollectionWrapper``) ensures that flush is called before the correct
    method calls. Two new API methods ``DataManager.get_collection(db_name,
    coll_name)`` and ``DataManager.get_collection_from_object(obj)``
    allows one to quickly get a wrapped collection.

- The ``MongoContainer`` class now removes objects from the database upon
  container removal is ``_m_remove_documents`` is ``True``. The default is
  ``True``.

- When adding an item to ``MongoContainer`` and the key is ``None``, then the
  OID is chosen as the key. Ids are perfect key, because they are guaranteed
  to be unique within the collection.

- Since people did not like the setitem with ``None`` key implementation, I
  also added the ``MongoContainer.add(value, key=None)`` method, which makes
  specifying the key optional. The default implementation is to use the OID,
  if the key is ``None``.

- Removed ``fields`` argument from the ``MongoContainer.find(...)`` and
  ``MongoContainer.find_one(...)`` methods, since it was not used.

- If a container has N items, it took N+1 queries to load the list of items
  completely. This was due to one query returning all DBRefs and then using
  one query to load the state for each. Now, the first query loads all full
  states and uses an extension to ``DataManager.setstate(obj, doc=None)`` to
  load the state of the object with the previously queried data.

- Changed ``MongoContainer.get_collection()`` to return a
  ``CollectionWrapper`` instance.


0.5.5 (2012-03-09)
------------------

- Feature: Moved ZODB dependency to test dependency

- Bug: When an object has a SimpleContainer as attribute, then simply loading
  this object would cause it to written at the end of the transaction. The
  culprit was a persistent dictionary containing the SimpleContainer
  state. This dictionary got modified during state load and caused it to be
  registered as a changed object and it was marked as a ``_p_mongo_sub_object``
  and had the original object as ``_p_mongo_doc_object``.


0.5.4 (2012-03-05)
------------------

- Feature: Added a hook via the IMongoSpecProcessor adapter that gets called
  before each find to process/log spec.

0.5.3 (2012/01/16)
------------------

- Bug: ``MongoContainer`` did not emit any Zope container or lifecycle
  events. This has been fixed by using the ``zope.container.contained``
  helper functions.

0.5.2 (2012-01-13)
------------------

- Feature: Added an interface for the ``MongoContainer`` class describing the
  additional attributes and methods.

0.5.1 (2011-12-22)
------------------

- Bug: The ``MongoContainer`` class did not implement the ``IContainer``
  interface.

0.5.0 (2011-11-04)
------------------

- Initial Release
