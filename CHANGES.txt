0.5.5 (unreleased)
------------------

- Feature: Moved ZODB dependency to test dependency

- Bug: When an object has a SimpleContainer as attribute, then simply loading
  this object would cause it to written at the end of the transaction. The
  culprit was a persistent dictionary containing the SimpleContainer
  state. This dictionary got modified during state load and caused it to be
  registered as a changed object and it was marked as a ``_p_mongo_sub_object``
  and had the original object as ``_p_mongo_doc_object``.


0.5.4 (2012-03-05)
------------------

- Feature: Added a hook via the IMongoSpecProcessor adapter that gets called
  before each find to process/log spec.

0.5.3 (2012/01/16)
------------------

- Bug: ``MongoContainer`` did not emit any Zope container or lifecycle
  events. This has been fixed by using the ``zope.container.contained``
  helper functions.

0.5.2 (2012-01-13)
------------------

- Feature: Added an interface for the ``MongoContainer`` class describing the
  additional attributes and methods.

0.5.1 (2011-12-22)
------------------

- Bug: The ``MongoContainer`` class did not implement the ``IContainer``
  interface.

0.5.0 (2011-11-04)
------------------

- Initial Release
